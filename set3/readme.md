TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

16:21: Starting with this weeks exercises after trying to figure out what was wrong with my last weeks code.

16:43 exercise 1 I wrote:
my_range = range(3, 10, 2)
my_list = list(my_range)
return my_list

(3 is the start number)
(10 is the stop number)
(2 is the step number) these must be in this order so the code can return the right answer

it returns the answer but I don't know how to do it the "long way" using a whole loop

DONE IT TOOK A WEEK BUT WE ARE DONE!!!
I slowly getting it
Finished 16/06/22 17:14

my_list = []
while start < stop:
my_list.append(start)
start.append(step)
return my_list

SUPER ASKER
Using the debug console allows you to test code before finalising and putting it in.
eg. num = 36
num > high False

to make a string which looks like a number eg ' 31' use int(i) to convert it back into a number

Watching back on Ben's session yesterday it was really helpful to understand how these loops work with asking for a user input and returning messages
