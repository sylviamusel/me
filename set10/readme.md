Data project readme

-I have had trouble with creating slope graphs. I decided to create a new filter data frame and use that information to make it. I realised that most tutorials online use much more simple examples and it was hard for me to find an answer with anything like mine which has many many columns and rows.

-I also realised that it was hard to find relevant datasets to relate to my original data. Eg. trying to find shark population to see how that impacted the number of attacks. I never thought that it was going to be so difficult I spent a good two hours trying to find extra data.

-I found that google have trends. So if all was lost I could easily see screch rates for certain things to see when people were searching these.

-I think this assignment was very insightful learning how to create graphs from some symbols, numbers and words. The most satisfying part was when code worked!

-Creating geo maps would have been great. Not even the tutors could figure it out which is sad but I think I did well never the less. I'm happy I'm done and proud of myself, especially coming from a non-related coding background
