TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

14:30: Currently in the lecture. A whole lot of information but nothing seems to be getting into my brain.

15:00: Getting started in the lab

START OF EXERCISE 0
14:40: why does this happen to me ? when running tests for set 2 it comes back with 15 total tasks rather than 34?
FIX: Sometimes when you auto fill it will make a link on the top code if this happens simply remove it if needed

NOTE TO SELF: To get into 'me' file type - cd me into the terminal. Allows you to navigate into different files

( ) calling functions
[ ] defining lists
{ } defining dictionaries, defining sets

the . (is a method) means to apply to function

18:05 f"" is an f function

It is currently the 15th/06/22 and I look back onto class still kind of confused. I'm going to attempt to go back on the exercises slowly at my own pace and see if I can get the hang of things before next lesson.

NOTE TO SELF: Important to return a value or it will be thrown away: eg return the_answer

START OF EXERCISE 1
Stepping through the code we are able to see if what we want the code to do is the same as what the code really does

gutters and break points allow you to stop execution on that line of the debugger

'len' means the length of the list

In the debug console you can type a statement eg. len(some_words) > 3 and it will tell you if it's true or false

.uname containing six attributes: system, node, release, version, machine, and processor.

START OF EXERCISE 2
NOTE TO SELF: some error messages aren't helpful it may underline some which is actually next to the real error

13:07: This is a good exercise. all done!

START OF EXERCISE 3
13:12: Starting exercise this is gonna take a while brb

% means modulus - divides and returns the value of the reminder

13:26: I've written the second one in 4 lines. to right in three line '==' can me used to say the the opps are also true

== compares the value or quality of two objects

to .append means to add another word/option into the list

Was trying to run test and it wasn't working. Problem solved remember to put the :
loop 2: You can use variable names from different loops to make life so much more easier
