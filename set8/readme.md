# IO stuff

. refers you are in
.. refers to a file back

utf-8 allows it to read and write all characters sets
f"{name} is cool and safe .... <- F string

read() <- reads everything as a string
readline() <- reads the first line, call again it reads the second line
readlines() <- reads as a list

import os
os.path.isfile(path_string)
\n\t <- n is a new line, t is a new tab

import random
for \_ in range(10)
print(random.randrange(0,4) <- print a random number between 0 & 3

     print(4 / random.randrange(0,4) <- divide by 4

expect ZeroDivisionError as z:
print("BOOM")

expect Exception as e: <- collects the error fast, try and find out
print(e)

## QUIZ

- so its 5:30 and I'm in 28/34
  honestly pretty proud of myself. I tried to do as much as a could by myself and was surprised. I didn't think I would get this far but I only asked for help 3 times! not bad from someone who has never touched code before this class. I kind of enjoyed this and learnt a thing or too. I guess putting us under pressure in class and allowing us to be able to search and talk to other students helped it feel like a proper professional environment with others.
- 5:45 and 29/34! WOOHOO
