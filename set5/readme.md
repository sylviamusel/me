WEEK 5 & 7 This log contains info from the week 5 lecture as well as the week 7 lab

14:10: starting lecture online today! will also log my online experience!

Pandas: is a library

notebook: continuously modifying the state, mix code, text and images, good way to communicate data analysis

Ctrl + Shift + P to search

# title

_italics_
csv: text based spreadsheet

.sample(3) pulls 3 random rows from the data

.head(2) fist 2 rows

## NaN: Not a number

penalty_data.iloc[1]

## allows you to see the data)

row_one = penalty_data.iloc[1]
row_one

## however assigning it to a variable it will be easier to find later

.plot
.hist more cleaner and easier to understand

point 14: boolean filter remove values or data over a certain number

Series: is a class looking at a single row or column
| means and

list comprehension to make a list and get more specific information out such as a letter (refer to pet name example)

ex. [p for p in pets] is a list comprehension gives the whole list

"barh" makes a horizontal bar graph

; hides the junk at the end means the same as plt.show()

range allows you to slide/zoom in to what you are interested in instead of cutting

16:30 Just figured out how to import csv file
export spreadsheet as a csv and import to software and save. Then open it so the code can read it and done! I really overcomplicated that!

Ask good questions - have interesting answers

Doing exercises I'm quite lost hopefully I can figure it out in class this week. I've been really far behind since being gone for nationals this past week. I guess its too late to get a extension on things ;-;

I'm following the panda's activity and trying to get the categorical values from my data set. The category "Activity" is working just find but when I want to get "Species" there is an error.

## so turn out that in the spreadsheet it's "Species " WITH A SPACE. I need to be more aware of title and how the spreadsheet was exported.

set 5 exercise 1:
Wordy_pyramid - I really overcomplicated this too much. I think I need to take it back a set and keep it simple. Will update when I figure it out
refactoring means to make code simple and more readable

get_a_word_of_length_n - (\*) (star)= multiplication operator

list_of_words_with_lengths - cont. from last activity

exercise 2:
pretty self explanatory - just took me a while to get the a = bba stuff right otherwise no issues there
