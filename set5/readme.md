TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

14:10: starting lecture online today! will also log my online experience!

Pandas: is a library

notebook: continuously modifying the state, mix code, text and images, good way to communicate data analysis

Ctrl + Shift + P to search

# title

_italics_
csv: text based speadsheet

.sample(3) pulls 3 random rows from the data

.head(2) fist 2 rows

## NaN: Not a number

penalty_data.iloc[1]

## allows you to see the data)

row_one = penalty_data.iloc[1]
row_one

## however assigning it to a variable it will be easier to find later

.plot
.hist more cleaner and easier to understand

point 14: boolean filter remove values or data over a certain number

Series: is a class looking at a single row or column
| means and

list comprehension to make a list and get more specific information out such as a letter (refer to pet name example)

ex. [p for p in pets] is a list comprehension gives the whole list

"barh" makes a horizontal bar graph

; hides the junk at the end means the same as plt.show()

range allows you to slide/zoom in to what you are interested in instead of cutting

16:30 Just figured out how to import csv file
export spreadsheet as a csv and import to software and save. Then open it so the code can read it and done! I really overcomplicated that!

Ask good questions - have interesting answers
