TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

WEEK 4 BABY!
15:18: start
mode = "w" means to write
mode = "r" means to read
requests: get info from somewhere else (using a url)

Status codes:
200: all goods
500: server error
400: user error (bad request)

we can change values in the variables window
file extensions can be named anything just gives a hint to the user on perhaps what it does

IO example: line 41 is the better way to do it

FOR AND WHILE LOOPS
ctrl C twice stops a infinite loop in the terminal

for loops are known stuff

while loops are for unknown stuff or unknown finishing point
{guard} allows you to see how many results have been produced by the loop

"normal string"
f"{}"
f string allows you to place things into strings

16:20: tried pair programming for the first time and it was very helpful. Got though some of last weeks work (set 3 exercises 1)

Open and closing files is easy to do but you might forget to close it. And it's important to close the file because I can break everything
../ means to go up to the previous file

mode r is usually the default

encoding="uts-8" allows you to write with any characters or symbols

\n\t means new line and tab

load
loads means load string

dump
dumps means dump string

Just completed exercise 1: nothing much went wrong just played around with the code and ran tests to see if it worked or not

exercise 2 is much harder tried messing around with different ways to change the length of words but ultimately failed miserably.
My code ended up being really long doing each line separately but I know that there is an easier way to do this
DONE! using two separate loops was the key. decrease the numbers from 20 and the other to increase.

POKEDEX now this one messed me up really bad.
At fist I was only getting Charizard as a answer when I ran the code. Using the debugging tool still couldn't figure out what was wrong. I knew I was missing lines to narrow down to the tallest pokemon.
First set of code made sense to me early on. it describes how to open the file and most of this was given to us at the start
Second set narrows it down looking at the height of the pokemon

Time to complete exercise 3 "lasers" I'm quite lost with this one. I've already started on it and have been working on it for the past hour.
