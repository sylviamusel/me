TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

WEEK 4 BABY!
15:18: start
mode = "w" means to write
mode = "r" means to read
requests: get info from somewhere else (using a url)

Status codes:
200: all goods
500: server error
400: user error (bad request)

we can change values in the variables window
file extensions can be named anything just gives a hint to the user on perhaps what it does

IO example: line 41 is the better way to do it

FOR AND WHILE LOOPS
ctrl C twice stops a infinite loop in the terminal

for loops are known stuff

while loops are for unknown stuff or unknown finishing point
{guard} allows you to see how many results have been produced by the loop

"normal string"
f"{}"
f string allows you to place things into strings

16:20: tried pair programming for the first time and it was very helpful. Got though some of last weeks work (exercises 1)
