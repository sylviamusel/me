Time to get down and dirty with this data project

Looking at pervious years work I've noticed some things which stood out to me the most that I could use in my presentation:

1. Have a clear title and what we explored in the data set
2. show data frame (original data frame)
3. Reshaping the data frame
4. Plotting on maps of locations
5. Find interesting insight and dig deeper

Plan:

- When in the last ten years have there been the most shark attacks?
  - Why was 2015 the most?
  - Which locations in 2015 had the most
  - What were people doing?
- Locations overall with the most
- Pick a year and see which season/months the most shark attacks happen
- In the last 5 years where in Australia did the most shark attacks happen?
  - Geo map plot which beaches exactly
